(teamRocket)Introduction
The sole ideology behind the development of the educative app "alpha-
cogn" is the realisation that all humans are unique, and everyone possess
knowledge of something that many other people may not. Hence, everyone
in the society can act as a teacher, as well as a learner.
Alpha-cogn is the platform which brings together the people who share the
zeal to teach and to learn. It is a platform where people can monitor their
surrounding for any ongoing educative sessions by speakers, or classes by
qualified students. At the same time, interested people may even choose to
share their own knowledge about any particular topic of any subject with
the people.
Subjects may widely range from Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology),
to Mathematics (Arithmetic, Trigonometry, Algebra), from Social
Sciences (Politics, International Affairs, Geography), to even Computer
Learning discussion sessions on topics like Android, Competitive
Programming, Introduction to MS Office, and what not. People have the
wide range of choices when it comes to choosing the venue for teaching
the topics, and for educative discussions.
These sessions may be conducted within their own premise, or people
could even set up the educative meetings over the weekends at some cafes,
libraries, etc. This also gives the platform to people who want to pursue
teaching as a profession, and not just as a social interaction.
The app provides a variety of courses and speaking sessions being
conducted around them currently, and in the upcoming month, and alsodisplays whether or not a course is free. User review and rating of
teachers by students, and rating of students by their teachers help to
maintain the quality of the users.
All in all, following are the features that have been proposed to be
integrated into the app:
 User account on the database that maintains every individual's
record as a teacher, and also as a student.
 Provision for a guest session.
 Choosing from a variety of classes and courses to undertake
(Science, Mathematics, Music, Parenthood, Health Care, Fine Art,
Computer Sciences, etc.).
 Identifying the Geopositions of the classes being conducted in the
surrounding radius. Refine the results according to the topic
preferences.
 Schedule a session on a particular topic as teacher. Choose from a
variety of topics, venue. Putting a payment is optional.
 Rating and giving feedback to students(by teachers/speakers), and to
teachers(by students).
Thank You.
